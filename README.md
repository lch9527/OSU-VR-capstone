# Virtual Reality Wood Harvester Simulator #
Our Virtual Reality Wood Harvester Project involves creating a VR experience comparable to a real harvester where the user can get effective training in operating a harvester within a safe environment and with less cost. This involves creating a realistic 3D forest environment that exactly resembles a real landscape with real tree locations. This also involves creating a functional Harvester in VR that has controls that mimic the real harvester. Meaning the user can operate the harvester in order to gain experience in delimbing and cutting down trees.
